    " ### Is it clear how the code is organized?  \n",
    " The code is very clearly organized; each function does a single, clear task  \n",
    "   \n",
    " ### Is the code properly documented with both docstrings and supplementary comments according to industry standards?  \n",
    " Overall, the code is properly documented. The only thing that should be fixed is the typo: 2x2 should be 2D instead.  \n",
    "   \n",
    " ### Can you follow the algorithm of the code, i.e., what it is doing, and how? Do you see any suggestions for how to improve the code?  \n",
    " The algorithm is very clear. The only thing I would add is a comment on lines 62-63 explaining why you divided by `(self.xlen-1)` and `(self.ylen-1)`. Why the minus 1?  "

    "**Advantage:**  \n",
    "1. very good mathmatic knowledge, and implemented \"real + imaginary*1j\".\n",
    "2. have good comments;  \n",
    "**Sugesstion:**\n",
    "1. if we use the following code in refresh() function, it will be more clear.\n",
    "```\n",
    "for imaginary in [self.ymax - self.ytick*i for i in range(self.ylen)]:\n",
    "         self.plane.append([(real+1j*imaginary) for real in [self.xmin + self.xtick*i for i in range(self.xlen)]])\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. `__init__()` function will be called automatically, and only once when define the function. So we'd better not call it in function `zoom()` and `set_f()`.\n",
    "3. It's not good to call function `set_f()` in `zoom()`, call `refresh()` in `set_f()`. Because it would be better for each function just implement on thing."
